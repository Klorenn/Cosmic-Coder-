# Changelog

All notable changes to Vibe Coder will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **README accuracy pass** — Corrected weapon count from 26 to 30 (16 base + 11 evolved + 3 legendary), evolution count from 10 to 11, quote count from "80+" to "95+"
- **Architecture diagram** — Added ASCII pipeline diagram showing real-time XP flow from dev tools through WebSocket to game engine
- **Technical Highlights section** — New table showcasing engineering decisions: zero-asset procedural generation, spatial hashing, real-time XP pipeline, procedural maps, and test coverage
- **Full evolution table** — Expanded from 5 shown + "discover more" to all 11 recipes with Special column
- **Deploy badge** — Added GitHub Actions deploy workflow status badge to shield row

---

## [0.6.6] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Split enemy health calculation** — Git-conflict split enemies used `enemy.health` (already 0 at death) instead of `maxHealth`, causing them to always spawn with only 10 HP instead of the intended ~28 HP
- **Vampiric healing uncapped** — Enemies with the vampiric modifier could heal infinitely past their spawn health because `maxHealth` was never set on regular enemies, and the fallback `enemy.health + healAmount` was always equal to the healed value
- **Missing `maxHealth` on regular enemies** — Added `maxHealth` property at spawn time, fixing both the vampiric healing cap and the split health calculation
- **XP server event listener memory leak** — `xpserver-connected` and `xpserver-disconnected` window event listeners were never removed on scene shutdown, leaking handlers on every game restart

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **README overhaul** — Portfolio-grade restructure documenting all game systems:
  - Added **Rebirth (Prestige) System** — 5 ranks from Junior Dev to Architect with stat/XP/weapon bonuses
  - Added **Run Modifiers** — 5 mutators (Glass Cannon, Vampiric Enemies, Bullet Hell, etc.)
  - Added **Interactive Shrines** — 5 shrine types with risk/reward mechanics (Power, Gamble, Wisdom, Protection, Chaos)
  - Added **Mid-Wave Events** — 5 dynamic events (Boss Incoming, Double XP, Curse, Jackpot, Swarm)
  - Added **Map Features** — Walls, hazard zones, destructible crates, teleporter pairs per biome
  - Added **Weapon Evolution Recipes** — Showcased 5 of 10 evolution combos with "discover more" hook
  - Added **Deadlock mini-boss** to boss table
  - Added **E key** for shrine interaction to Controls section
  - Added **Save & Continue** system documentation
  - Restructured features into Core Gameplay → Meta-Progression → Run Variety narrative flow
  - Added Tests badge to shield row, Vitest to Tech Stack
  - Expanded Permanent Upgrades table with per-level values and max total bonuses

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **36 RebirthManager unit tests** — Full coverage of the prestige/rebirth system:
  - `MILESTONES` — shape validation, ascending wave order, sequential rebirth levels
  - `load/save` — localStorage persistence, default state, corrupted JSON recovery
  - `canRebirth` — wave threshold checks, milestone progression, max level guard
  - `performRebirth` — level updates, kill accumulation, highest wave tracking
  - `getAllStatsMultiplier / getXPMultiplier` — bonus scaling per rebirth level
  - `getStartingWeaponCount / getStartingWeapons` — weapon cap, pool validation, no duplicates
  - `getRebirthInfo` — display data, INTERN fallback, next milestone, lifetime stats

### Changed
- **Test count** — 66 → 102 total unit tests across 5 test suites

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Double hazard damage** — `handleHazardDamage()` was subtracting health internally AND returning the damage value for the caller to subtract again, causing 2x damage from hazard zones
- **MapManager tween memory leak** — Infinite tweens (`repeat: -1`) on walls, hazards, and teleporters now tracked and explicitly stopped on `clearMap()`, preventing tween accumulation across stage transitions
- **WebSocket reconnection race condition** — Added `connecting` state guard to prevent duplicate connections when `onclose` fires during a pending reconnect attempt
- **Negative health values** — Player and enemy health from hazard damage now clamped to 0 via `Math.max()`, preventing negative health that could break HUD display and auto-play EVADE logic

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Test infrastructure** — Vitest testing framework with `npm test` and `npm run test:watch` scripts
- **102 unit tests** across 5 test suites covering core game systems:
  - `SpatialHash` — cell key mapping, insert/clear, getNearby radius queries, cross-cell boundary lookups
  - `RunModifiers` — modifier selection, combined effect multiplier/flag merging, getById/getAll lookups
  - `SaveManager` — getTimeAgo time formatting across seconds/minutes/hours/days boundaries
  - `EventManager` — event definitions, active effects, effect application/clearing, trigger guards
  - `RebirthManager` — milestones, load/save, canRebirth, performRebirth, multipliers, weapon selection, info display

### Changed
- **README** — Expanded project structure to document all 6 systems (EventManager, MapManager, RebirthManager, RunModifiers, SaveManager, ShrineManager), all 3 utils (SpatialHash, audio, socket), and the test directory
- **README** — Added Testing section with test commands and coverage summary

---
