All notable changes to Vibe Coder will be documented in this file.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **31 ShrineManager unit tests** — New test suite covering shrine system data integrity and logic:
  - `SHRINES` — 5 shrine definitions with required fields, unique ids/names, valid hex colors
  - `Shrine specifics` — POWER cost/buff values, GAMBLE free entry, XP cost/levelup, SHIELD weapon-for-invincibility trade, CHAOS health-for-random-effect
  - `GAMBLE_OUTCOMES` — 5 outcomes, weight distribution sums to 100, NOTHING most common, JACKPOT rarest
  - `CHAOS_EFFECTS` — 6 effects with unique keys, includes SPAWN BOSS (dangerous) and INVINCIBILITY (beneficial)
  - `canPayCost logic` — free/null always payable, health threshold check, XP sufficiency check
  - `getBuffMultiplier` — returns 1 with no buff, correct multiplier when active, 1 for unrelated type
  - `Constructor defaults` — shrines array, activeBuffs, shrinesPerMap, interactRadius
- **19 SaveManager persistence tests** — Expanded test coverage from time formatting to full save/load lifecycle:
  - `saveRun` — success return, correct key, timestamp/version, wave/stage/player preservation, Set-to-array conversion, QuotaExceededError handling
  - `loadRun` — null for missing save, valid data round-trip, 24h expiry enforcement, corrupted JSON recovery, auto-cleanup of expired saves
  - `hasSave` — false when empty, true after save
  - `clearSave` — removes from storage, hasSave returns false after
  - `getSaveSummary` — null when empty, summary fields, "just now" for fresh saves

### Changed
- **Test count** — 143 → 193 total unit tests across 7 test suites

---

## [0.7.4] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **41 GameMechanics unit tests** — New test suite covering core gameplay formulas and data integrity:
  - `XP Curve` — monotonicity, integer output, known-value checks, positive-only guarantees
  - `Player Stats Scaling` — base stat formulas, attack rate floor clamping, modifier stacking (damage, health, shrine, rebirth), Glass Cannon half-health
  - `Spawn Pool` — weighted pool builder, waveMin enforcement (no early spawns), spawnWeight frequency, pool growth across waves
  - `Weapon System` — 16 weapons with unique colors, damage non-negativity, melee/ranged invariants, balance relationships (spread trades damage for projectiles, pierce > basic damage)
  - `Evolution Recipes` — 11 recipes with valid base weapon ingredients, unique result names, no self-combination
  - `Enemy Balance` — XP reward scaling with difficulty, hallucination harmlessness, segfault one-shot design, waveMin completeness
  - `Crit Chance` — base 10%, upgrade scaling, non-negative guarantee

### Changed
- **Test count** — 102 → 143 total unit tests across 6 test suites

---

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Pause menu keyboard handlers accumulate** — `destroyPauseMenu()` destroyed visual elements but never called `keyboard.off()` for the 6 listeners added in `pauseGame()`. After N pauses, pressing UP/DOWN/ENTER triggered N stacked callbacks, causing erratic menu navigation and wasted CPU
- **Weapon drop infinite tweens leak after destroy** — Weapon drops created with `createTrackedTween` (infinite pulse) were destroyed via plain `drop.destroy()` on both pickup and expiry paths, leaving orphaned tweens in `activeTweens` Set. Now uses `destroyWithTweenCleanup()` to stop tweens and remove from tracking
- **Shrine interact prompt tween survives scene shutdown** — `ShrineManager.createInteractPrompt()` created an infinite `repeat: -1` pulse tween but never stored the reference. `destroy()` destroyed the container but the tween kept running against a dead target. Now stored as `this.promptPulseTween` and stopped in `destroy()`

---

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **15 announcement texts invisible off-camera** — Wave complete, boss spawn, mini-boss, weapon evolution, legendary weapon, rm-rf, sudo mode, XP magnet, music toggle, game restart, and respawn texts were placed at world coordinates without `setScrollFactor(0)`, making them invisible when the player was away from the top-left corner of the 2400x1800 map
- **Event timer bar negative/overflow scale** — `EventManager` timer bar could scale below 0 or above 1 on edge cases where `remaining` exceeded `totalDuration` or went negative, causing visual glitches. Now clamped to [0, 1]
- **Empty spawn pool crash guard** — `spawnEnemy()` could crash with `TypeError` on `undefined` access if `buildSpawnPool()` ever returned an empty array (defensive guard added)

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Data-driven enemy spawn pool** — Replaced 50-line cascading if-chain in `spawnEnemy()` with `buildSpawnPool()` method that reads `waveMin` and `spawnWeight` directly from `enemyTypes` definitions. Adding a new enemy now requires editing one line instead of three separate locations
- **Single source of truth for enemy textures** — Eliminated 19-entry `textureMap` object by adding `texture` property to `enemyTypes`. Texture resolution now falls back to the enemy type name, matching existing convention for original enemies
- **Consistent `waveMin` on all enemies** — Original 6 enemies (bug, glitch, memory-leak, syntax-error, infinite-loop, race-condition) now have explicit `waveMin` values instead of relying on hardcoded if-statements

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Gameplay screenshot** — Hero image (`docs/gameplay.png`) captured from live deployment showing Wave 7 with Double XP event, enemies, shrines, and procedural map
- **Multi-CLI integration table** — Documented pre-built hooks for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor, and generic tools with per-tool XP bonuses
- **Immortal Mode documentation** — Added accessibility feature description to Controls section (respawn on death, 50% XP penalty)

### Fixed
- **Quote count accuracy** — Corrected "95+ unique quotes" to "75+ unique quotes" after verifying against source code (75 actual quotes across idle, coding, time-based, and CLI-specific categories)

### Changed
- **Integration section renamed** — "Claude Code Integration" → "AI Coding Tool Integration" to reflect multi-tool support
- **Changelog summary** — Updated inline changelog to show latest 3 versions

---

## [0.6.9] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **Weapon color single source of truth** — Eliminated 32-entry duplicate `weaponColors` map in `updateHUD()`. All weapon colors now derived from `weaponTypes` and `evolutionRecipes` definitions, making color mismatches impossible when adding weapons
- **`hexToColorStr()` utility** — Extracted 6 repeated inline `toString(16).padStart(6, '0')` conversions into a single reusable method used by stage nodes, boss names, modifiers, boss announcements, mini-boss announcements, and evolution effects
- **`getWeaponColorStr()` lookup** — New method resolves any weapon type (base, evolved, or legendary) to its CSS color string by walking `weaponTypes` first, then `evolutionRecipes`

### Fixed
- **Kunai HUD color mismatch** — Kunai displayed as `#4a4a4a` in the HUD but was defined as `0x2f2f2f` in `weaponTypes`. The duplicate color map had drifted. Now impossible since colors derive from the single definition

---

## [0.6.8] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Evolved weapons never expired** — Weapon expiry timer compared the pre-evolution weapon type instead of the final evolved type, so evolved weapons (Laser Beam, Plasma Orb, etc.) became permanent until replaced
- **Immortal respawn invincibility cut short** — The i-frame flash timer from `playerHit()` was stored as a local variable and continued running after death, overwriting the 2-second immortal respawn invincibility after only ~1 second
- **Stage transition text invisible** — "ENTERING [stage name]" text was placed at world coordinates (400, 200) without `setScrollFactor(0)`, making it off-screen unless the player happened to be near the top-left corner
- **Missing XP multipliers on alternate kill paths** — Orbital weapon kills, legendary weapon kills, and AOE blast kills all bypassed XP event/modifier multipliers, giving raw un-multiplied XP during Double XP events
- **AOE blast kills dropped no weapon pickups** — Unlike projectile and legendary kills, AOE blast enemy deaths never called `spawnWeaponDrop()`, removing a loot source

---

## [0.6.7] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **README accuracy pass** — Corrected weapon count from 26 to 30 (16 base + 11 evolved + 3 legendary), evolution count from 10 to 11, quote count from "80+" to "95+"
- **Architecture diagram** — Added ASCII pipeline diagram showing real-time XP flow from dev tools through WebSocket to game engine
- **Technical Highlights section** — New table showcasing engineering decisions: zero-asset procedural generation, spatial hashing, real-time XP pipeline, procedural maps, and test coverage
- **Full evolution table** — Expanded from 5 shown + "discover more" to all 11 recipes with Special column
- **Deploy badge** — Added GitHub Actions deploy workflow status badge to shield row

---

## [0.6.6] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Split enemy health calculation** — Git-conflict split enemies used `enemy.health` (already 0 at death) instead of `maxHealth`, causing them to always spawn with only 10 HP instead of the intended ~28 HP
- **Vampiric healing uncapped** — Enemies with the vampiric modifier could heal infinitely past their spawn health because `maxHealth` was never set on regular enemies, and the fallback `enemy.health + healAmount` was always equal to the healed value
- **Missing `maxHealth` on regular enemies** — Added `maxHealth` property at spawn time, fixing both the vampiric healing cap and the split health calculation
- **XP server event listener memory leak** — `xpserver-connected` and `xpserver-disconnected` window event listeners were never removed on scene shutdown, leaking handlers on every game restart

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **README overhaul** — Portfolio-grade restructure documenting all game systems:
  - Added **Rebirth (Prestige) System** — 5 ranks from Junior Dev to Architect with stat/XP/weapon bonuses
  - Added **Run Modifiers** — 5 mutators (Glass Cannon, Vampiric Enemies, Bullet Hell, etc.)
  - Added **Interactive Shrines** — 5 shrine types with risk/reward mechanics (Power, Gamble, Wisdom, Protection, Chaos)
  - Added **Mid-Wave Events** — 5 dynamic events (Boss Incoming, Double XP, Curse, Jackpot, Swarm)
  - Added **Map Features** — Walls, hazard zones, destructible crates, teleporter pairs per biome
  - Added **Weapon Evolution Recipes** — Showcased 5 of 10 evolution combos with "discover more" hook
  - Added **Deadlock mini-boss** to boss table
  - Added **E key** for shrine interaction to Controls section
  - Added **Save & Continue** system documentation
  - Restructured features into Core Gameplay → Meta-Progression → Run Variety narrative flow
  - Added Tests badge to shield row, Vitest to Tech Stack
  - Expanded Permanent Upgrades table with per-level values and max total bonuses

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **36 RebirthManager unit tests** — Full coverage of the prestige/rebirth system:
  - `MILESTONES` — shape validation, ascending wave order, sequential rebirth levels
  - `load/save` — localStorage persistence, default state, corrupted JSON recovery
  - `canRebirth` — wave threshold checks, milestone progression, max level guard
  - `performRebirth` — level updates, kill accumulation, highest wave tracking
  - `getAllStatsMultiplier / getXPMultiplier` — bonus scaling per rebirth level
  - `getStartingWeaponCount / getStartingWeapons` — weapon cap, pool validation, no duplicates
  - `getRebirthInfo` — display data, INTERN fallback, next milestone, lifetime stats

### Changed
- **Test count** — 66 → 102 total unit tests across 5 test suites

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Double hazard damage** — `handleHazardDamage()` was subtracting health internally AND returning the damage value for the caller to subtract again, causing 2x damage from hazard zones
- **MapManager tween memory leak** — Infinite tweens (`repeat: -1`) on walls, hazards, and teleporters now tracked and explicitly stopped on `clearMap()`, preventing tween accumulation across stage transitions
- **WebSocket reconnection race condition** — Added `connecting` state guard to prevent duplicate connections when `onclose` fires during a pending reconnect attempt
- **Negative health values** — Player and enemy health from hazard damage now clamped to 0 via `Math.max()`, preventing negative health that could break HUD display and auto-play EVADE logic

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Test infrastructure** — Vitest testing framework with `npm test` and `npm run test:watch` scripts
- **102 unit tests** across 5 test suites covering core game systems:

  - `RunModifiers` — modifier selection, combined effect multiplier/flag merging, getById/getAll lookups
  - `SaveManager` — getTimeAgo time formatting across seconds/minutes/hours/days boundaries
  - `EventManager` — event definitions, active effects, effect application/clearing, trigger guards
  - `RebirthManager` — milestones, load/save, canRebirth, performRebirth, multipliers, weapon selection, info display
