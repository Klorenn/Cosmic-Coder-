# Vibe Coder - Session Log

## Session 1: 2026-01-15 (Brainstorming)

**Status:** Design complete, ready for implementation

### What We Decided
- **Game Type:** Vampire Survivors-style arena (top-down, auto-battle)
- **Art Style:** 16-bit pixel art
- **Tech Stack:** Phaser 3 + Vite + Node.js backend
- **XP Sources:** Claude Code hooks (real-time) + GitHub API (polling)
- **Character:** "Cyber Ronin" - hooded rogue, Tron aesthetic, gangster aura
- **MVP Scope:** Tiny - prove the loop works (1-2 weeks)

### Design Doc Location
`docs/plans/2026-01-15-vibe-coder-design.md`

### Next Steps (When Resuming)
1. **C) Generate assets** - Use AI (nano-banana) to create:
   - Player character sprites (8-direction idle + walk)
   - Enemy sprites (Bug, Glitch, Memory Leak)
   - Basic tileset for arena floor

2. **A) Start building** - Scaffold the project:
   - Initialize Vite + Phaser 3
   - Create file structure
   - Build ArenaScene with placeholder graphics
   - Wire up Claude Code hooks
   - Get the loop working

### Resume Command
Just say: "Let's continue building Vibe Coder - start with assets"
